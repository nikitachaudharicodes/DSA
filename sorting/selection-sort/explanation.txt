selection sort is a comparision based algorithm

- sorts by repeatedly selecting the smallest/largest element from the UNsorted portion & swapping with the first element in the UNsorted portion

- continue till array sorted


- only work with UNsorted portion for each run. 
- eventually will keep sorting all as u keep swapping

TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n^2) 

2 loops: 

1. select element of array one by one : O(n)
2. compare with every other array element : O(n)

== O(n)*O(n) = O(n*n) = O(n^2)

space: O(1)  only temporary variables. 

disadvantages: 
slower than merge sort and quick sort.
does not maintain relative order of equal elements.


advantages:
simple, easy
small datasets - small keys, large objects
