init is  a special method in python class:

called automatically when u create an instance of a class

job is to initialize the attributes or properties of an object

also called 'initializer' or 'constructor' method


Basic syntax:

class MyClass:
      def _init(self, arg1, arg2, arg3...):
        #initialization code here
          

  'self' parameter above refers to the instance of the object being created.
  you can pass any other arguments you need.

  Example:

  class MyCat:
      def _init(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

  #create an instance of the MyDog class
  my_cat = Dog("Miso", 6)

  #the init method is automatically called - takes the parameters -name, age- and assigns them as attributes to the object my_cat

  USES:
  set up default values 
  validate input data when creating objects
  good place to define instance specific attributes
